Brief 
Create a console application that emulates a lottery of numbers. Your program must allow the 
user to select their own numbers from a predefined range of values. Once all values have been 
selected the program will then generate a series of random numbers and compare the users' 
values with those. The number of values that match with those the user picked from the 
randomly generated numbers will be displayed for the user to see how many they got correct. 
 
Requirements 
The application must: 
1. Take user input to store values they select into an array structure. 
2. Write a custom Linear and Binary Search and use the Binary Search to find the matching 
values in the array. 
3. Only allow values within a predefined range. 
4. Handle any input validation gracefully, while informing user if incorrect. 
5. Where necessary display outputs to user for prompt and feedback. 
6. Allow for customisation of the application by ensuring the following values are variables: 
a. The total number of values that the user must enter / are generated randomly. 
b. The range of numbers that are accepted for input / to be selected from randomly. 
 
Problem Breakdown 
To help break down the application and problem into smaller chunks here are some tasks to 
complete as a guide. There is a further breakdown attached in the appendices. 
 
Task 1 – Create a program that allows users to enter values and store these into an array. 
Task 2 – Take a screenshot of you debugging your program at a breakpoint showing the values 
have been entered into the data structure correctly. 
Task 3 – Create a random number generator that fills a second array with random numbers. 
Make sure they are within the range the user can input. 
Task 4 – Demonstrate understanding of two methods of searching on an array using a Linear 
and binary search algorithm. 
Task 5 – Write the rest of the application by using the search function and check each of the 
user entered values against the random ones. Let the user know the outcome. Give different 
outcomes for different results. 
Task 6 – Test and debug your program to ensure it meets ALL requirements. 
 
Deliverables 
1. Zipped application including all solution files and folders. 
2. Screenshots showing breakpoint use and debugging of values inside the array.
